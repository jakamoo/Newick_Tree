• Write a C code which does the following:
• Your program will read a file named input.txt
• input.txt contains single line text. The text describes a tree structure. It follows the Newick format rules.
But there are simplifications and/or modifications:
– Each node is represented by a single character. They are separated by comma. Branching is described by
matching parentheses.
– The length of the text will not be greater than 250
• Below is an example of a tree description:
(A,(c,B,e),K,D,e,(f,(d,F)))
• This tree can be visualized as follows:
-A
--c
--B
--e
-K
-D
-e
--f
---d
---F
• Another example:
(A,(A,A,(A),A),A)
• Visualization:
-A
--A
--A
---A
--A
-A
